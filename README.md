VBA Homework
This is my VBA homework. I recieved guidance from a number of people and used a handful of resources as well. My classmates, Julia Smith and John Goodale gave me some feedback that helped me overcome two challenges (an overflow error and a problem with cell reference, respectively). The combined feedback from Mr. Goodale and one of the TAs, Joe Thompson, helped me address a divide by zero error that resulted from a particular part of the dataset.
