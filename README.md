VBA Homework
This is my VBA homework. I recieved guidance from a number of people and looked at a handful of online resources as well. My classmates, Julia Smith and John Goodale gave me some feedback that helped me overcome two challenges (an overflow error and a problem with cell reference, respectively). The combined feedback from Mr. Goodale and one of the TAs, Joe Thompson, helped me address a divide by zero error that resulted from a particular part of the dataset. 
I consulted various web sites and forums as I explored solutions to some of the problems I faced. For isntance, I found the correct function for finding a maximum value on an OzGrid message board. Overall, I found ExcelJet.net, MrExcel.com, and TrumpExcel.com the most helpful. They all contained clear explanations of reasons for common error messages, which helped me as I debugged my macro.
